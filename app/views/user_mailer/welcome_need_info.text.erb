Welcome <%= @user.fname %>!

With your noncents account you're on your way to funding the longest vacation of your life (a.k.a. retirement).

  For a couple of housekeeping items:

  - Money transfer is handled by our partner, Dwolla Inc. In signing up for noncents you've also created an account with them and accepted their privacy policy and TOS.
  - Additional information is needed to verify your identity before noncents can transfer money. Please make sure your information (address, social security number, etc.) is correct in the app and resubmit it.

If you have any questions, send us a note at feedback@noncents.co.

Cheers,

noncents Team
